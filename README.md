Hello World
This program will ask theuser their name and then take that and print it back out and then will ask them their mood and based on what they say itll say a different response

This program does what is advertised, and then some. It takes your name and greets you like the project is supposed to, but it also lets the user input the way that they are feeling and gives 1 of 4 responses based on what the user puts in. It also checks the user's name input to see if it's only numbers with no text. I'm a big fan of formatting, so there are a few things I would recommend adding to make the program look even better. A console clear every few lines help keep the console clutter free, and a while loop will make sure that the user has no option but to input one of the options you give them. Still, nice work!
